Your code is already documented with docstrings, so there's no need to add additional documentation. The main class and its methods have appropriate, well-written, easy-to-understand docstrings that follow Google's multi-line format. If you want to further document this code, consider adding specific information about what each method does, what each argument represents, and what values each method returns.
