    - DistanceTaskConfig: Configuration class for distance task.
    - DistanceTask: Main class for distance task.
    - OneHotTaskConfig: Configuration class for one-hot task.
    - OneHotTask: Main class for one-hot task.
    - PretrainedTaskConfig: Configuration class for pretrained task.
    - PretrainedTask: Main class for pretrained task.
    - AffinitiesTaskConfig: Configuration class for affinities task.
    - AffinitiesTask: Main class for affinities task.
    - InnerDistanceTaskConfig: Configuration class for inner distance task.
