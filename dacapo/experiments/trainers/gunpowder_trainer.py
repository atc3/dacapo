"""
Contains the GunpowderTrainer class that inherits from the Trainer class. The GunpowderTrainer class is used
for assembling and managing the training pipeline of a machine learning model leveraging the gunpowder library.
Gunpowder is a library that provides a way to assemble machine learning pipelines from a few modular components.

Imports:
    TrainingIterationStats from ../training_iteration_stats, Trainer from .trainer, 
    Specific required constructs from the dacapo and funlib libraries, gunpowder, torch, time, logging, numpy and zarr 
    for constructing, manipulating and tracking the data pipeline and training process.

class GunpowderTrainer(Trainer):
    """
    The GunpowderTrainer class leverages the gunpowder library for assembling a pipeline for training a model.
    
    Constructs:
        GunpowderTrainer configs:
            num_data_fetchers: Integer indicating the number of pre-fetch workers allocated for the pipeline.
            augments: Array like object containing the types of augmentation required for the dataset.
            mask_integral_downsample_factor: Integer value for downscaling the mask array.
            clip_raw: Boolean value indicating the necessity to Crop the raw data at GT boundaries.
            dataset sources: Array-like object indicating the datasets required for the training process.
            raw, gt, mask: Defines the raw input, ground truth and mask for the dataset.
        
        Important features:
            Optimizer: Configures a RAdam Optimizer for the model.
            Loss Calculation: Utilizes the task's loss function to evaluate model performance after each training epoch.
            Training iterations: Manages the training process through multiple iterations.

            During Snapshot Iteration - (selected iterations when model snapshot is saved):
                Snapshot arrays like raw, gt, target, weight, prediction, gradients and mask together with their axis
                attributes are stored to monitor and evaluate the model performance.
