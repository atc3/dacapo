def interpolatable(self):
    """
    A property method that checks the possibility of interpolation.

    Interpolation is a method of estimating values between two known values in a 
    sequence or array. Since this is an annotation array, interpolation doesn't make 
    sense as the array primarily represents classes or categories.

    Returns:
        bool: Always returns False stating the array is non-interpolatable.
