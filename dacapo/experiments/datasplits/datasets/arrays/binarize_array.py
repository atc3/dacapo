class BinarizeArray(Array):
    """
    BinarizeArray is a class that is used to create a binary classification for 
    a group of labels inside a ZarrArray.

    This class provides an interface to handle classifications that are expressed as a mix
    of different labels. It achieves this by merging the desired labels into a single binary
    channel for a particular class. One key feature of this implementation is that different
    classes can have overlapping labels.

    Attributes:
        attrs: contain properties related to the source array.
        axes: return a list of channel and axes of the source array.
        dims (int): return the dimensions count.
        voxel_size (Coordinate): return the voxel size.
        roi (Roi): return region of interest of the source array.
        writable (bool): flag to show if array is writable, always return `False`.
        dtype: standard data type of the elements in the array is np.uint8.
        num_channels (int): return number of grouping.
        data: raise ValueError as this array only modifies another array on demand.
        channels: lazy iterable of the names in groupings.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if a writable view is requested of the array.
