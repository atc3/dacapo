```python
"""
This python script is essential for importing key classes from the keys module in the current directory for the Dacapo library. 
The imported classes include ArrayKey, GraphKey, and DataKey, which serve as identifiers for various types of data in the library.

Classes:
    ArrayKey: Class for managing unique identifiers for Array data type.
    GraphKey: Class for managing unique identifiers for Graph data type.
    DataKey: Class to manage Data keys.
"""
from .keys import ArrayKey, GraphKey, DataKey
```
Without sounding verbose, the script imports three classes from the keys module - ArrayKey, GraphKey, and DataKey. These classes are likely to serve as identifiers or keys for distinguishing between different types of data in Dacapo's functionalities.
